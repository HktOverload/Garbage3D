- [ ] Generate basic terrain that is either a mountain or valley
- [ ] Get distance fog to work with a predetermined amount of fog
- [ ] Implement interpolation for drawing the distance fog
- [ ] Perform depth sampling and do the math for light scattering
- [ ] Calculate max percieved render distance with fog
- [ ] Clip tris (and don't even load chunks) that are far enough away
- [ ] Scale the number of samples with the intended amount of fog
- [ ] Update distance fog samples in a realistic way when the camera is moved

Week 5:
