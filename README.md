# Garbage3D

A slow and sketchy 3d graphics engine made with tkinter 

For 112 TAs: Project plan is at `TP1_PROJECT_PLAN.md`.

- This was supposed to be a 3d game made with tkinter
- But then it turns out tkinter is way too slow
- So now it's just a very bad 3d graphics engine
- If you have too many triangles the Python interpreter crashes
- If you don't believe me look in `ftw.txt`
- Yep
- I told you it's slow and sketchy
