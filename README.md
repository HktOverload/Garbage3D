# Garbage3D

A slow an sketchy 3d graphics engine made with tkinter 

- This was supposed to be a 3d game made with tkinter
- But then it turns out tkinter is way too slow
- And it started crashing when there were too many triangles
- So now it's just a very bad 3d graphics engine
- If you have too many triangles the Python interpreter crashes
